# TrilhaX - Safe & Compact Lua Functions  

Welcome to **TrilhaX**, a small collection of **safe and line-saving Lua functions**, designed to make scripting easier, especially for Roblox.  

## ðŸš€ About the Project  

I created these functions to prevent common issues, such as accessing non-existent objects or getting stuck in infinite yields when waiting for elements. They also help **reduce code repetition** by encapsulating frequently used logic into simple, reusable functions. In short, they make scripting **safer and cleaner**, without the need to rewrite the same checks repeatedly.  

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside  

Hereâ€™s a summary of the available files and their functionalities:

## âœ… Why I Created This  

- **Prevent crashes** when objects do not yet exist.  
- **Save time and lines of code** by eliminating repetitive checks.  
- **Make my code more readable and maintainable.**  
- Have a **personal toolkit** for any project, without worrying about small mistakes.
