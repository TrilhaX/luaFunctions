# TrilhaX - Safe & Compact Lua Functions  

Hey! This is **TrilhaX**, a small collection of **safe and line-saving Lua functions** I made to help with common tasks when scripting, especially for Roblox.  

## ðŸš€ About  

I built these functions to avoid common errors like trying to access nil objects or infinite yields when waiting for children. They also help me **write less code** by wrapping repetitive logic into simple, reusable functions. Basically, they make scripting a lot safer and cleaner without having to repeat the same patterns over and over.  

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside  

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve added:  

| File                             | What It Does                                    |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `autoExecAfterTP.lua`             | Automatically runs your script after teleporting. |
| `fireButtonAllMethods.lua`        | Safely fires all usable methods on a button.   |
| `firePromiximityPrompt.lua`       | Fires a ProximityPrompt safely if it exists.  |
| `getCFrame.lua`                   | Gets an object's CFrame safely or gives a default. |
| `safeCallToGetChildren.lua`       | Safely gets all children of an instance.      |
| `safeCallToWaitForChild.lua`      | Waits for a child safely, avoiding errors or infinite waits. |
| `tweenForMobs.lua`                | Tweens mobs safely and easily.                |
| `tweenForObjAndNpc.lua`           | Tweens objects and NPCs with checks.          |  

## âœ… Why I Made This  

- To **avoid crashing scripts** when objects donâ€™t exist yet.  
- To **save time and lines** by not writing the same checks all the time.  
- To **make my code easier to read and maintain**.  
- To have a **personal toolkit** that I can use in any project without worrying about small mistakes.
